Answer:
1) Why did you structure your HTML this way?
    I made my HTML in a way that keeps everything organized and easy to use by not only using semantic tags, but also sectioning different parts of the game off in classes. This makes the game much easier to work with in the actual code.
2) How does your JS handle different user paths?
    It handles different user paths by checking what the player clicks or types. For example, when they press start, it begins a new game. When they make a guess, it checks if it’s right or too high or low, and gives hints or ends the game if they win or run out of tries. This way, the game can change what happens based on what the player does.
3) What would you improve with more time?
    If I had more time, I would make the game better by adding fun features like sounds or pictures.
