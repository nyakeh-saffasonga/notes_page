    EXIT TICKET

    1. An event listener is a fucntion that "listens" for a specific event. These events are triggered by user actions such as keystrokes and mouse movements.
    2. We need callback functions so that websites are functional and actually do things when users interact with them.
    3. I learned that mouse movements count as events.
    4. I would try to do something about that minor delay in the 'keydown' function.
